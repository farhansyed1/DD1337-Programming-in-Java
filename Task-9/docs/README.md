**S.6 Optimization** <br>
The method can be improved by skipping even numbers and only going through
odd numbers as it is evident that even numbers are not prime. <br>
This can be implemented by using an if-statement that checks if the number is divisible by 2. <br>
The tests will still work because this is just an optimization.
